**What does PEAS stand for? Why need it?**
In order to design a rational agent, the task must be specified
- Performance Measures 
- Environment
- Actuators
- Sensors

**Examples for autonomous vehicle and bargain hunter:**

**Name 4 Types of Environment:**
- Fully Observable vs. Partially Observable
- Deterministic vs. Stochastic
- Episodic vs. Sequential
- Single Agent vs. Multi agent

**Classify the types of enviroments for autonomous vehicle and bargain hunter:**

Reason why

**Name the 4 types of agents:**
• Simple reflex agent
• Model-based reflex agent
• Goal-oriented agent
• Benefit-oriented agent


**What type of agent is this:**

Name 4 Types of Problems:
Single state problem (Deterministic, fully observable):
- Agent knows exactly what state he will be in
- Solution is sequence

Conformant Problem (Non-observable):
- Lack of observability can cause uncertainty at baseline and mean in effects of actions
- Solution (if any) is sequence

Contingency problem (nondeterminism. and/or partially observable):
- Perception provides new information about the current state
- Solution is contingency plan or guideline (policy)
- Search and execution are often intertwined

Exploration problem (Unknown state space)
- "Online"
